# Bird OS 2017 1.0.0a (Western Schreech-Owl)


Welcome!
For now this is a hobby project. It's far from finished, also it is still in a planning state. I am looking for the correct language.
Some things might not be up-to-date.


#Why the name Bird OS?

Well, I started this project but of course it needs a name. I like my own birds too much to choose another name! :)

#What's the plan?
I am planning to make eventually a desktop enviroment. Altough this is very difficult to do, I am going to try it!!!
Also, I hope it will support some of the .exe sorts. An Internet browser and file browser would be good too.

#LICENSE:

Although it has no license I would like to ask you if you can mail me when you want to use stuff.
